# Diwan

Diwan is a Rust-based, Vim-like text editor designed for performance, memory safety, and concurrency,
providing a fast, efficient, and secure user experience. Inspired by the rich
tradition of Arabic poetry compilations known as "Diwan," this project aims to integrate terminal
features and address gaps in existing editors while honoring cultural heritage.
