# Diwan Text Editor - MVP To-Do List

## Logo
- [ ] a logo is needed for Diwan's community.
## Core Features
- [ ] **Implement logic for closing the editor gracefully**  
  Ensure Diwan has a proper mechanism to close, saving any necessary state and cleaning up resources.

- [ ] **Add file saving from the buffer**  
  Enable users to save the current text from the active buffer into a file.

- [ ] **Set up the File Manager component as a crate**  
  Develop a modular file manager to handle file navigation and organization, making it a separate Rust crate.

- [ ] **Load existing files into the editor's buffer**  
  Allow users to open and load text files into Diwan's buffer for editing.

- [ ] **Create new files within the editor**  
  Implement the ability to create and edit new, untitled files directly within the editor.

## User Interface (UI) and Interaction
- [ ] **Design a status line showing key buffer metadata**  
  Display useful information like file name, line/column numbers, and current mode in a status line at the bottom of the editor.

- [ ] **Compose and display a status line in the viewport**  
  Render the status line in the main editor viewport so users can track their file and cursor position.

- [ ] **Add a splash screen on editor startup**  
  Display a simple splash screen when the editor is launched, creating a welcoming visual for users.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)
- [ ] **Support file paths as arguments in the CLI**  
  Enable users to open specific files by passing their file paths as arguments when launching Diwan from the command line.

- [ ] **Show help message for incorrect CLI arguments**  
  Provide informative error messages and usage instructions if the user mistypes or passes incorrect arguments in the CLI.

## Visual Design
- [ ] **Design a logo for Diwan**  
  Create a simple, meaningful logo that represents Diwan and aligns with its aesthetic and functionality.

## Future Additions (Optional for MVP)
- [ ] **Implement a 'boot' feature for the editor**  
  Develop functionality for initializing the editor with custom configurations or presets upon startup.

### Notes for Contributors
These tasks represent the core functionality and visual elements needed
to make Diwan a usable text editor. Feel free to propose improvements
or enhancements as you work through the list. Each task should be
approached with modularity and simplicity in mind, following
Rustâ€™s philosophy of safety and performance.
